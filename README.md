Edge touch issue fixxer üìè
Created by:Kautsar0907

This android shell script was for fixing the edge touch issue on fog (redmi 10c) or miui 13 android 12

Universal script (Support Non root and root devices)

If your device doesn't have this issue then just don't download and install it



How To Install:
Non root: use adb shell to install,example:adb shell sh (the file in the directory) 

Root:use Terminal Emulator or Termux,it's same as how to install in non root device (Optional: su)

Thanks!
